#### Description:

This is an app to register a person's dreams. They can add multiple categories to each dream, as well as select if it was a lucid dream or not. The dreams are presented like blog posts on the front page, the categories can be seen, altered and added in a specific page.

I used a lot of my knowledge from weeks 8 and 9 to develop this app. I have many ideas to create, and I decided to go with something that would be ready faster. I know I still have many things to learn and I want to learn them all! Right now I am close to starting a new programming course, so my deadline was a bit short.

After creating the basic features of my app, I saw that Flask has a Blueprint for blogs that would work perfectly for this. Lesson learned: check documentation **before** starting! :D

It took me around one week to do this project, considering I have around 4h/day to do it. The most difficult part was checking all the syntax details: indentation, names of variables that would check with database columns... I had to redo my database a few times to get it right, and work with Sqlite3 to make some queries, make sure everything was working.

I also struggled with understanding some errors shown in the terminal. ChatGPT and CS50 Duck helped a lot with those.

I used the CS50 VSCode on my PC to work on most of it, so the seminars were really essential for me to set it up. I have used it on my PC before for other courses, but I learned a lot while making sure that everything I did on my PC was, indeed, in the CS50 cloud.

***Pages:**

* My Dreams - This page shows every register on your Book, the most recent on top.

**Layout:**

I used Bootstrap to:

- Make a responsive website
- Create a nice-looking, responsive menu
- Manage the containers and spaces for the contents of my pages
- Create a good-looking footer
- Add styles to my buttons and set their positions
